# tetris_project_2022

Made for Computer Programming 12 @ Heritage Woods Secondary
The instructor provided parts of the code, but I created and organized most of the functions. 

# In retrospect:
This file should have been split into multiple files. All the functions and operations are on the same file, making it chunky and disorganized. If I were to remake this project I would start with properly organizing my functions and classes.

# Bugs
- There is a small period between the falling block colliding with the locked-in block where if it is moved the falling block is left floating.
- There are occasional moments when collision code fails and the block either falls through the whole screen or merges with the locked-in blocks.
